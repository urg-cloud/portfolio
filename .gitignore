The miles between us keep growing longer,
The bond we shared now feels so much weaker.
Your voice on the phone, it just doesn't reach me,
The way that it did when you were here with me.
Chorus:
Her love is not like before,
The spark we had, it's not there anymore.
I'm so confused, should I stay or should I go?
'Cause her love is not like before.


I see the photos you post online,
Laughing with friends, living your life.
It used to be me by your side,
Now I just watch from the sidelines.

Her love is not like before,
The spark we had, it's not there anymore.
I'm so confused, should I stay or should I go?
'Cause her love is not like before.

I want to hold on, to what we had,
But I can see the change, it makes me so sad.
Maybe it's time I let you go,
And let you live the life that you chose.

Her love is not like before,
The spark we had, it's not there anymore.
I'm so confused, should I stay or should I go?
'Cause her love is not like before.
